## HardWare & System

### Propane gas leak detection by infrared absorption using carbon infraredemitter and infrared camera(2011)
- overview:<br>
This study introduces a propane gas leak detection system based on infrared absorption using a carbon infrared emitter (CIE) and an infrared camera. 
    - The hardware includes a CIE transmitting infrared wavelengths of 1–5 μm, a parabolic reflector for uniform infrared radiation, and a Raytheon-Amber Radiance HS infrared camera equipped with an indium antimonide (InSb) detector. The study uses a bandpass filter centered at 3.37 μm to isolate the absorption band of propane gas. 
    - Infrared intensity changes due to propane absorption are analyzed to create real-time images of gas leaks. The algorithm correlates the intensity and concentration-pathlength product to evaluate hazards.
